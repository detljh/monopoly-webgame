# Monopoly Board Game 
This is a monopoly board game on the web created using React and Redux.
Play it [here](https://monopoly-webgame.herokuapp.com/).

## Rules
1. Players cannot buy properties on the first round of the board.
2. Once properties have been mortgaged, they are available for other players to buy if they land on it.
3. Money payed from landing on tax or drawing a card will go to Free Parking.
4. Landing on Free Parking will allow you to receive the money in it.
5. Rolling a double three times in a row will move you to jail.
6. To escape the jail, you must either roll a double, pay $50, or wait for three turns.
